Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?    

Emergent properties are the unexpected behaviors that result from the interactions between components in a large, complex system. These properties are difficult to recognize because oftentimes these components are not being designed/built/tested by the same company or team looking to connect it to a larger system, so there is a blackbox effect. The system designers/developers understand what must go in and what will come out but do not know how it produces the output from a given input. There may be code within one component that changes the expected behavior of another component; even though both components may be well-documented and easy-to-understand, itâ€™s impossible to know how two independent components will interact. This assumes that the components are even well-documented, it could be the case that a lack of documentation for a component will also lead to these emergent properties simply for a lack of understanding as to what the component is actually doing.
