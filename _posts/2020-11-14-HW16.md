You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for the services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the company’s employees, customers, and shareholders.  
  
  
Anytime the word coerce is used in regard to higher fees, it is certainly an unethical practice by default. While the suits may enjoy the sneaky cash grab, from the point of view of the employees and customers what a shameful and awkward technical support call that would be.   
  
“Hi nothing works on my end. Is there a problem?”,   
  
“HI this is expected behavior. Please subscribe to premium bundle in order to make anything work at all.”  
  
Ethically, it’s horrible. The company developing the service should have some responsibility to their clients. These are whole businesses that rely on the service, without it, they may experience significant loss in profits or worse they may not be able to continue keeping the lights on.   

From a reputation point of view, something like forcing clients into paying even more money for a service will only leave a bad impression. These clients may just decide to take their money to a service provider that won’t jerk them around for a few extra bucks.
