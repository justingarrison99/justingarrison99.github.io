Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of error are unlikely to be discovered through inspections.


Program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program because it entails a person or team literally reading the code line by line. By going over each line of code these inspections are able to reveal Syntax, Interface, and Semantical errors (to name a few) within the code compared to just having a test framework scrutinize the code.

 Errors that are unlikely to be discovered through program inspection would be component interactions as well as service-based software interactions, because itâ€™s difficult to predict the emergent behaviors of a system without having the program running.
