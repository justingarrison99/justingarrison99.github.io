Hello! My name is Justin Garrison. I'm a senior at the College of Charleston studying towards a Computer Science degree. I was first introduced to programming/Computer Science when I began to write simple mods for Minecraft. I play rhythm guitar in a band here in Charleston, and we're expecting to release an EP in the near future.
